# MDK (Matt's Development Kit)

Hi, I'm [Matt Hackett][richtaur], game developer (and [book author][htmavgaby]) at [Valadria][valadria], a small game studio.

This project houses (some of) the CLI tools I use to help me make (and promote) my video games.

_Note: This is a fairly messy personal project, but it's quite powerful!_

## Primary Purposes

Some of **mdk**'s many features:

* Batch image/video resizing
* Video compression
* Video conversion
* Audio normalizing
* GIF creation

## How to install

1. First install [yarn][yarn], an open source package manager
2. In the `mdk` directory, run `yarn`
3. To make `mdk` globally available on your computer, run `yarn global add <path to mdk>`
	* e.g. `yarn global add ~/dev/personal/mdk`
4. To upgrade `mdk`, run `yarn global upgrade <path to mdk>`
	* e.g. `yarn global upgrade ~/dev/personal/mdk`

## How to use

Run `mdk` to show the help prompt.
